# Context of the Proposal

For 25 years between 1948 and 1973 a number of psychological researchers undertook observations and recording of goings on in a small rural down in Kansas. In their publications, the town is referred to as Midwest, and the extensive examination of the behaviour of people and the places in which they lived offers us some of the deepest insights into the relationship between behaviour and the environment available to psychological science.

The research team developed a theory of how places and people are related according to structures they term “behaviour settings”. The theory is a detailed account of how people's actions are motivated, shaped, and supported by the physical and social characteristics of the situation in which the behaviour is evoked. Put simply, in order to predict a person's behaviour the single most useful piece of information you can have about them is not any fact about them as an individual, but rather what behaviour setting they are in. People in school behave school, people in church behave church. Behaviour settings theory systematises our understanding of how the real places in which people live and work play a substantial role in explaining those people's behaviour and experience.

# Build on a Proven History for an Impactful Future

Despite the potency of the theory as demonstrated by the work of the Midwest team the theory is not well known within mainstream psychological research. In recent years this has begun to change, as the value of the work is increasingly appreciated and relationships to other growing approaches to psychological research are recognised. In addition, advancements in technology mean that the prolonged observations of people in real world settings that was central to the development of behaviour setting theory are much more practicable and convenient than was the case in the mid-twentieth century.

We propose a two-day conference will act as a bridge between the history and future development of behaviour setting theory. The funding sought will support the travel and accommodation costs (no speaking fees are associated) of invited keynote speakers, along with costs associated venue and other organisational considerations. Invited speakers will both present their own work relevant to the theme of the meeting, and participate in panel discussions in which the import and implications of behaviour settings theory, and the methods and analytic techniques of the Midwest research team will be elucidated in depth. Encouraging involvement of early career researchers from a diversity of backgrounds will ensure that the foundations of the existing work are built on for maximum range of impact into the future.

The theme of the meeting is: The Midwest Psychological Field Station – Looking Back, Looking Forward.
Looking back, we will focus on the particular work of the Field Station team, their methods, analytical techniques, and insights. Two of the grant applicants have visited the Field Station archives and will present new insights directly from that extensive work. In addition, invited keynote and regular speakers will explore the implications of behaviour setting theory for psychological research methods and psychological science more generally. The work will be discussed in historical context, within the development of psychological science in the 20th century, but also with a more modern viewpoint, examining the ways that insights from the Midwest work can inform and support on-going changes in practice, methods, and analyses as psychology copes with various methodological and scientific “crises”.

Looking forward we will explore how new research work is extending behaviour setting theory, and putting it to work in new contexts, with new tools, integrated with new theoretical and philosophical approaches. Building on the insights of the historical work, and including the early career researchers with on-going projects, this section of the conference will examine how the Midwest work can help shape our use of new technologies and measurement techniques, and inform our analysis of difficult empirical questions. Particular attention will be paid to recent developments of embodied, embedded, and ecological work, and how these theoretical advancements can both refine and learn from behaviour settings theory.

The conference will form the basis for a new international research network centred around behaviour settings research, linking senior scholars, mid-career academics, and early career researchers.
